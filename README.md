🖥️ 5. How to Run the App

💾 7. Data Storage

Your data is automatically saved in finance_data.csv (same folder).
You can open it anytime in Excel or Google Sheets.

Example CSV:

2025-10-02	Expense	Groceries	Weekly shopping	2500
🧩 8. Optional Improvements

Here are some ideas to enhance the project:

✅ Add data visualization (using matplotlib or seaborn)
✅ Add input validation loops (instead of returning early)
✅ Convert to a Tkinter GUI or Streamlit web app
✅ Add JSON backup or cloud sync option
✅ Add search and filter features (by date or category)

🚀 9. Run & Test

Once you’ve verified everything works:

python finance_tracker.py


Your tracker is ready to use 🎉
